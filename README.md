This is the backend code for my chatapp which is named Capp.Users have to login or register to get chat. The only way users can chat with each is if they follow each other,after they have followed each other thier chat will occur on the conversations list. Select whichever chat you want to, realtime message exchange can then take place. You can also alter your profile details such as firstname,lastname,status,or profile image. The app is deployed on render.com here is the url to app: url:https://capp-l9ts.onrender.com
